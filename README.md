This repository contains a JavaScript example demonstrating a common error in handling null values. The function `foo` attempts to add two numbers, but its handling of null values is incorrect, leading to unexpected results. The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version. The correct function should explicitly check for null values and handle them appropriately, either by throwing an error or returning a default value. This example highlights the importance of robust null handling in JavaScript to avoid unexpected behavior and runtime errors.
